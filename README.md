# Stroke Prediction Using R Programming

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally. This fact encouraged me to do stroke data prediction. The goal is to find out factors that lead people for getting stroke. And also to predict whether someone is likely to get stroke based on several parameters like their age, gender, age, and smoking status.

The dataset used can be found in Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset)
